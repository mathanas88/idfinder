Identity Finder

Identity finder will search your local folders for text matching certain identifying information such as Social Security Numbers, phone numbers, Drivers License, etc.

The user will provide information via commandline or config file. The reg ex's will be stored in a config file as well so they can be altered for changes to format in identifying information.
